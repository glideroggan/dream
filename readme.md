# BUGS
- why is only the minus button on error-widget triggering resize?
- cancel button on loan modal on sign step is not hover styled
- cancel button on the signing workflow is not good in dark mode
- ‚úîÔ∏èLets create a custom checkbox component that we can use
- would be nice if forms and forms with several steps could remember their data in the inputs
  especially when the user is navigating back and forth
- the transaction signing is not so nice, the style of it should improve
- need toast error when failing to start a workflow
- when there is only one choice from the search inputs, enter key should select it
- favorite checkbox doesn't work on add payment contact
- need to update net worth after account and transaction changes
- all the amounts, should be positive, and instead the type of the transaction should be the one that decides if it is showing as a negative value or not
- the button in the bottom in financial health widget is unstyled

# FEATURES
- common search dropdown component
  Would be nice to just have one component that works
  - search have one
  - add contacts have one

## new workflows
- edit payment contacts
  Doesn't need to be a "page", can just be a workflow, showing different buttons for doing things
    - edit
    - add
    - remove
  Once done, it goes away
## interval based tasks
Would be nice to get a bit more things happening, if we could do like in the life cycle service, but for other things, like loan due payments coming in, then it would actually look like a real bank account
- transaction simulation
- create a simulation of card activation by letting the card go through the activation process
  - create a lifecycleService for cards
    - it should save the time of the last step
    - when active on the site, the simulation should run, start from main
    - steps
      - pending
      - processing
      - approved
      - shipped
      - delivered
        - should cause an event, so that user can now activate the card
        - should show a toast

# TODO
- start saving widgets urls in cache, no need to try to fetch them every time, only those that are not in the cache or have failed
- lets save the dark/light mode selection
- add github build action
- try to clean up more from the widget-wrapper
- fix the product service to look like the other services
- getting time to release
## account info
- account info workflow, needs an empty/default state when no account is selected
  - the empty state should have a smart dropdown
## transfer workflow
- transfers should be able to be scheduled
  - create a repo for scheduled transfers
    these would be checked at intervals, and then processed, if "late" then just change created date to when it were supposed to be processed
## the loan workflow
- should the "elegible accounts" have a "create new account" button?
- doesn't show any of my accounts to deposit the loan into
  - home loan
    - shouldn't have the length of the loan in months, should already be set over a specific time
    - shouldn't have a purpose
  - purpose dropdown doesn't show any options
## search
## financial-health-widget
- the goals are created on the accounts? they should be separate entities
  - when there is more than 1 recommendation, you can't see it
## create account workflow
  - it could be wider, so that when selecting an account, you get the description of the account to the right
## account-widget
  - transfer button does nothing in widget empty state
    - fixed with toast?
  - clicking on a connected card should take you to the card-detail-workflow
## card workflow
- the workflow seems to have some default KYC values, we should make sure we take the KYC data from the service
## KYC workflow
  - probably should sign that kyc with the signing workflow




# TODO
- add more unit tests
  - settings-repo
  - transaction-repo
  - user-repo
- üîßcan we include some colors?
  ok, this was hard, and failed, lets try again later and commit more often on good changes
  - can we include some fonts?
- search should be smart enough to show "new" documents
  - when a document have been created, the search should have it under "new"
- we need a document widget
  - how big will this be?
  - will it have a search?
  - or will the global search be able to search for documents?

# BE
- arch? bun, deno, node?
- document should be cached and static as much as possible
- we can serve the document from an api, and dynamically fill in importmaps

# bankid workflow

# account widget
- should there be a single insight/recommendation in the header of the account widget?
  that can sum the entire thing up?



# financial health widget
- score should be nicer



# workflow
- maybe pinnable?
  - Do they become widgets? 
    - they would need the wrapper?
- being able to save workflows
  I might be on page 3, and want to pause/save to do something else
  and have the ability to continue later



# TODO
- Start looking at the Signals API and see if we can do something with that instead of the way it is now
  - looks like this is more just for aborting certain actions, so if anything, we could use it to abort fetches
- add a "chaos" layer for repositoryService
  - when the feature is on, when requesting the repository, it will sometimes return a chaos layer on top of the requested repository
  - when asking for data, it will sometimes return an error
  - when asking for data, it will sometimes return a timeout
  - when asking for data, it will sometimes return a 500
  - when asking for data, it will sometimes return a 404
  - when asking for data, it will sometimes return a 200, but with an empty array
  - when asking for data, it will sometimes return a 200, but with a different array
  - when asking for data, it will sometimes return a 200, but with a different object
- add tests to already built
  - components
  - services
  - repositories
- ‚úîÔ∏èimportmaps
  - it doesn't look like we can "download" a json acting as an importmap, but nothing is stopping us from hitting an api that creates the document for us, and at that time we can create the JSON file for the importmap
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_modules_using_import_maps

## workflows
## mfes/widgets
### Financial-Health-widget
  - make this work with slots
  This means that the Financial Health widget are supposed to have these widgets, but these widgets can also be found through search, and added to the home page, or any other page, and resized to fit the layout
- be able to resize widgets
  
# Features
- Toast
  - Give some visual feedback when completing workflows or other actions
  - when creating an account
- Create a coach mark feature
  - Let the welcome-widget use it to demonstrate how to use the app
- create a better FE logger
  - should have categories, so that we can choose to see the logs of a workflow, modal specifics, etc
- rearrange widgets
  This is a big change. But it should be just the grid-layout and the widget-wrapper
  


# menu
## theme pages
## pages
### home
- What more do we want to show on the home page?
  - a loan widget (if you have the product)
  - a product widget, where you can easily get certain products
  - a savings insight widget (if you have saving accounts)
  - a pension widget (if you have a pension account)
### accounts
- show a more dedicated page with more information about the account
- show a list of upcoming payments

# widgets
- We should be able to order them
   - Drag it below one, and it should be placed below that one?
- We should be able to remove them
   - How do we get it back?
## Savings
### smartness
## accounts‚úîÔ∏è
- ‚úîÔ∏èaccounts needs to look into upcoming transactions, so that we can show the total amount of upcoming payments
### smartness
- ‚úîÔ∏ècheck if there is any upcoming payment that will make the account go negative
## loan widget
- show the total amount of the loan
  - a nice bar showing how much you have paid off
- show the next payment
- need to have a loan for having the widget
- is a product
- loans create upcoming transactions, as this is a recurring payment
### smartness
- can we suggest a better loan?
- can we suggest a better payment plan?
- can we suggest a better interest rate?
- can  we suggest to increase the amortization when we have a lot of capital?
## new products
- a widget that shows new products
- clicking a product shows more information about the product (workflow)


### swish‚úîÔ∏è
- We need to think about how the swish widget should look like, because it is a phone app

# workflows
## kyc
- should trigger when opening a new pension account
  - workflows should send a notification?
  - we could set a flag on the account, that we have a pending kyc
    This could then we check at intervals and show the modal
## transfer‚úîÔ∏è
- we should translate between different currencies
- we should be able to transfer to other banks
- ‚úîÔ∏èshould create transactions
  - ‚úîÔ∏èwe need a transaction repository
    - a transaction can be recurring
      - We want this to be a checkbox on the transfer workflow
      - this will require some mocked logic in FE for actually processing the transaction at that date
        - for BE, this wouldn't be a problem, but in FE we can just fake it, by checking if the date is today or later, and then just marking it as completed, but at the date it should been processed
