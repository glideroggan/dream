# BUGS
- add contact workflow is overflowing the modal
- ‚úîÔ∏èthe transfer-workflow is a bit overflowing the modal, in width
- when you add the swish widget, you can't remove it until you reload, or switch page
- ‚úîÔ∏èmodal primary buttons keeps their last workflow text, we need to reset it when closing

## create-new-account-workflow
- Account name do not update when switching between accounts

# TODO
- no feedback when adding a new account
  - toast?
- add tests to already built
  - components
  - services
  - repositories
- üîßchange the welcome widget to be more introductive
  - ‚úîÔ∏èit should be able to close
    - ‚úîÔ∏èso widget preference needs a repository
- writing something in search, and then trying to tab over to result box, doesn't work
- We need to start refactor individual files, as they start to grow, and could be split into smaller files
- dismiss the search result with esc
## workflows
- edit payment contacts
  Doesn't need to be a "page", can just be a workflow, showing different buttons for doing things
    - edit
    - add
    - remove
  Once done, it goes away
  - maybe pinnable?
## mfes/widgets
  
# Features
- create a better FE logger
  - should have categories, so that we can choose to see the logs of a workflow, modal specifics, etc
- add toasts
  - when creating an account


# Worksflows (explain how the work with the modal, base and manager)
Looks like there are different events
workflow-complete: emitted by workflow-base, no one seems to listen to this
workflow-completed
workflowComplete: emitted by modal, catched by workflow-manager, to be used when multiple workflows are in the same modal
Which one should we use? and why are there different ones?

# menu
## theme pages
## pages
### home
- What more do we want to show on the home page?
  - a loan widget (if you have the product)
  - a product widget, where you can easily get certain products
  - a savings insight widget (if you have saving accounts)
  - a pension widget (if you have a pension account)
### accounts
- show a more dedicated page with more information about the account
- show a list of upcoming payments

# widgets
- We should be able to order them
   - Drag it below one, and it should be placed below that one?
- We should be able to remove them
   - How do we get it back?
## accounts‚úîÔ∏è
- üîßmore details on a specific account, implement the three dots
- show a total of the upcoming payments on each account
- accounts needs to look into upcoming transactions, so that we can show the total amount of upcoming payments
### account details
- Where should we show this?
  it opens today in a modal, which is fine, but that means we should add another type, not a workflow, but an info?
### smartness
- check if there is any upcoming payment that will make the account go negative
## expenses
- Should show some insights about the expenses
- Should show a list of expenses
## loan widget
- show the total amount of the loan
  - a nice bar showing how much you have paid off
- show the next payment
- need to have a loan for having the widget
- is a product
- loans create upcoming transactions, as this is a recurring payment
### smartness
- can we suggest a better loan?
- can we suggest a better payment plan?
- can we suggest a better interest rate?
- can  we suggest to increase the amortization when we have a lot of capital?
## new products
- a widget that shows new products
- clicking a product shows more information about the product (workflow)


### swish‚úîÔ∏è
- We need to think about how the swish widget should look like, because it is a phone app

# workflows
## kyc
- should trigger when opening a new pension account
  - workflows should send a notification?
  - we could set a flag on the account, that we have a pending kyc
    This could then we check at intervals and show the modal
## transfer‚úîÔ∏è
- we should translate between different currencies
- we should be able to transfer to other banks
- ‚úîÔ∏èshould create transactions
  - ‚úîÔ∏èwe need a transaction repository
    - a transaction can be recurring
      - We want this to be a checkbox on the transfer workflow
      - this will require some mocked logic in FE for actually processing the transaction at that date
        - for BE, this wouldn't be a problem, but in FE we can just fake it, by checking if the date is today or later, and then just marking it as completed, but at the date it should been processed
